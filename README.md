repost (Deprecated)
======

A CoffeeScript command line tool to share previously published posts in Twitter.

## Deprecated

I decided to deprecate this project for a series of different reasons, to mention some of them:

- Simpler, pure JS project, 
- Do not restrict myself to only Twitter, instead use Buffer App
- Since I am now using Buffer App, I do not need to handle post scheduling inside the code

The latest code is now hosted at [Bitbucket][bb] to make my life easier to maintain a public repo and a forked private one with AppFog settings.
